# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

This project is a deep learning-based system for detecting potato diseases using image classification. The model is trained on a dataset containing healthy and diseased potato leaves.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The app is deployed on [Streamlit](https://charan.streamlit.app/) and can be accessed via the link below:

[Potato Leaf Disease Detection App](https://charan.streamlit.app/)

## ðŸ›  How to Run Locally

To run this app locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Deep130804/POTATO-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION.git`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using pip:

`cd POTATO-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

After the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app with the following command:

`streamlit run web.py`

### 4. Access the App

Once the app starts, it will automatically open in your browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by going to the following URL:

`http://localhost:8501`

### 5. How It Works
> Upload an image of a potato leaf.  
> The model predicts if the leaf is healthy or diseased.  
> If diseased, it suggests possible treatment methods.
